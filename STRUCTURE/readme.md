Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.

Unlike an array, a structure can contain many different data types (int, float, char, etc.).

struct MyStructure {   // Structure declaration
  int myNum;           // Member (int variable)
  char myLetter;       // Member (char variable)
}; // End the structure with a semicolon
